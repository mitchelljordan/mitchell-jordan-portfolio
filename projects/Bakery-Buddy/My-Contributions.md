# Backend Developer:
### Baking Process and Sales:
This was my first project as a backend dev, and my job was to set up the API routes for the frontend while maintaining security while doing it. My main task was setting up the full functionality
from when the ingredient came in to when the product was sold. A system that required some thought was baking, and how does that turn into a product? This one operation
subtracts ingredients and adds batches to the recipe, and then it will be sold by one of the products it is attached to. With all of that happening in one operation, I am proud of how clean the code is.

### Authorization:
My other relatively big task was authorization. I did not make the authorization, but the frontend devs needs, and the other backend being unabliavle I had to setup to build what I belive a good security system.
Originally, the other backend dev had CORS Headers in every API file, which made me want to make it far less redundant. The way I did this was by having middleware at the top of the API directory,
where then it is simply to check where the request is going, if they are authorized, or if it is a public URL for easy access.

### Database Connection:
I also made the .ENV for secure DB connection.
